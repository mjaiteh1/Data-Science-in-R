<b> A brief description of the data, including the source </b> 

I'm looking at Capital Punishment for Juveniles in the United States. I was interested in this because capital punishment for juveniles existed until 2005 So I wanted to know which states were involved and how many juveniles were excecuted. I took this data from Wikipedia.

<b> Which tool(s) did you use to get it? To clean it? To analyze it? </b> <br>
To scrape the data, I used python and I imported the beautiful Soup library and the resquests library. To visualize the data I used Tableau.
```{python}
#import requests
#from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```
<b> What patterns/trends did you find in the data? </b>

When I was looking at the CSV file, I was able to see all the juveniles and the methods that was used to execute them. While looking at that I did miss that 
Texas had the highest number of juvenile execution. I noticed that Georgia, Louisiana and South Carolina were the only states that used electrocution.
This is interesting because they are all around each other so it makes sense that they all used electrocution.
